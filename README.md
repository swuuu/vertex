## Vertex
This is a productivity app created mainly with react ([link])(https://vertex-app.herokuapp.com/). The project was inspired from [Momemtum](https://momentumdash.com), a chrome extension productivity tool.

## Features
* 2 different types of tasks creation: University tasks and other tasks
* to-do list with tasks that are draggable for organization/ priority management
* a timer to track the time spent on a task
* a table which keeps track of job application
* data memorized by localStorage 

## Bugs/To-dos
* Implement form validation
* Make it responsive/mobile-friendly
* Fix some form bugs
* Style the input elements of the form
* Clean/Shrink code of the form components
* Fix warnings
* Something happens which makes the memory footprint of the tab increase. The increase never stops until the site crashes. However, most of the time, the
memory footprint is constant.
